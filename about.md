Miaoding received his BS in Mechatronics Engineering from Zhejiang University in China in 2017. During his time as an undergrad, he took not only a variety of courses on mechatronics and control theory, but also learned practical skills in embedded programming, 3D modeling and simulation, and prototyping, which qualifies him for electromechanical system integration.

Miaoding is interested in the perception part of robotics, and plans to focus on areas such as localization and planning, computer vision, and sensor fusion. Because coding is the universal language in the world of robotics, in the MSR program, he spares no efforts to polish his coding skills to allow him to freely communicate with robots. After graduation, he will dedicate himself to developing practical and affordable robotic devices, for manufacturing or daily life, to bring robotics everywhere.
